# KodiNFOMusicVideos

Create and Edit Kodi NFO files for Music Videos collection.

This is a complete rewrite of my previous two attempts and is now an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app. Currently I can only build the excutable for Windows so if you would like to use in on macOs or Linux you'll need to clone the repository and either run or build it yourself. I will be looking into solutions for the other platforms.

## Main Features

- Scans your music video media folder for video files and associated `.nfo` and artwork.
- Displays a list of the music videos with a summary of the available metadata and artwork.
- List can be filtered by metadata and artwork as well as searches with file names, artists and title.
- Individual videos can have their metadata and artwork edited.
- Parse artists and title from file name including automatic stripping of extraneous information like '(Official Music Video)'.
- Inline video player for `.mp4` and `.webm` files. Both `.mkv` and `.avi` extensions are supported but will only display if using codecs supported by browsers.
- Lookup panel feature scans various information providers with links to the asscoiated page:
  - IMDb.com for title, premiere date and actors. If no exact match is found a list of potentials is presented.
  - IMVDb.com for artists, title, premiere date, directors, actors and fan art. If no exact match is found a list of potentials is presented.
  - MusicBrainz.org for artists, title, premiere date, album, genres, studios and thumbnail.
  - TheAudioDB.com for artists, title, album, genres, directors, studios, plot, thumbnail, CD art, clear logo, clear art, artist thumbnail, banner, landscape and fan art.
  - Wikipedia.org for artists, title, premiere date, album, genres, studios, plot, thumbnail and fan art.
  - Fanart.tv will be included if a MusicBrainz match is found. Artwork can include thumbnail, CD art, clear logo, clear art, artist thumbnail and fan art.
- Add artwork by browsing the local file system, drag-and-drop from local file system, drag-and-drop from web page and drag-and-drop from lookup panel or any web page.
- Unlimited fan art with add and remove buttons.
- Remove existing artwork.
- Context menu on video can save current frame to artwork including auto-creating new fan art slots.
- Zoom any piece of artwork to the full window.
- Rename music video file and the associated `.nfo` and artwork.
- Light and dark interfaces.

## How to use

The Windows app is portable. After launching the application for the first time it will check the current folder for video files. If you place it in the same folder as your music videos you'll be good to go otherwise you will be presented with a folder selection interface. Enter or browse for your music videos folder.

Once your folder is set a list of your music videos will display. A 'View' tab at the bottom of the list will reveal the filter options. The action bar at the bottom of the app has a back button, light/dark toggle, settings and about page.

Click any of the music videos to enter the editor which features a 'Lookup' tab at the bottom of the editor. The video will display at the top with the file name below and a button to the right of that to automatically fill the artists and title field based on the file name. Once a title is set the 'Lookup' button will be enabled and once pressed will search the information providers. Override fields for artists and title are available for tricky/alternate variations. Once the data is retrieved you can click on the labels to populate the relevant field and drag-and-drop artwork. The action bar adds buttons to navigate through your music videos list as a save button.

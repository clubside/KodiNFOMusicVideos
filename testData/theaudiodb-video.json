      "strDescriptionEN": "\"Saving All My Love for You\" is a song written by Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin with arrangement by Gene Page. It was originally a minor hit for Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. in 1978 on their album Marilyn & Billy. A cover of the song was done by American recording artist Whitney Houston, for her debut, self-titled album, which was released on February 14, 1985, by Arista Records. The song was the second single from the album in the United States and third worldwide.\n\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who picked it as one of the album's highlights and praised her vocals on the song. Whitney also earned her first Grammy Award with the song, on the category Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Commercially, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, being her first number one on the charts; it also went to number one in the UK and Ireland, and was her first song to chart in those countries. In the United States, it was awarded a Gold certification from the RIAA.\n\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" was written by Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin during the 1970s and originally recorded with Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. on their LP \"Marilyn and Billy\" (1978). Years later, Masser saw Whitney for the first time when he went into New York City's Sweetwater club, an invitation made by Arista Records president Clive Davis, and she was singing one of his songs, \"The Greatest Love of All\". After her performance, the singer told Masser that the song was one of her favorites and later, Masser was chosen by Arista to produce some tracks for Houston's self-titled debut. After getting the right emotionally vulnerable-tailored take from Houston, the producer guaranteed her that it would become \"a woman's song\", meaning that women will feel a special affinity for the song.\n\nAfter the success of her previous single, \"You Give Good Love\", the label initially didn't think about releasing \"Saving All My Love for You\" as the next single. When Masser heard that another single besides the song was being considered for the next single, he made a friendly wager with Davis during one of Houston's performance at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. He proposed that if all the women get on their feet when Houston sings \"Saving...\", then Davis would agree that it should be the next single. Ultimately, the song was released as the second single in the United States and third single worldwide.\n\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" is a soul and R&B song, composed in the key of A major, having a slowly tempo of 84 beats per minute. Houston's vocal range on the song span from the low-note of F#3 to the high-note of E5. The song features a saxophone solo by Tom Scott and lyrically talks about a young woman preparing for the arrival of her married lover, with lyrics like, \"You've got your family, and they need you there/Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list/But no other man's gonna do/So I'm saving all my love for you.\" Dave Heaton of PopMatters wrote that Whitney sings some parts with bittersweet lightness (\"that\u2019s just an old fantasy\") and other parts with urgent heaviness (\"tonight is the night\"), exactly right for carrying the feelings in the song.\n\nThe song also caused controversy due to its lyrics about having an affair with a married man. Houston's mother Cissy Houston didn't at all like the scenario described in the lyrics, claiming that the song's message would reflect badly on her daughter. However, Whitney herself confessed, \"I was going through a terrible love affair. He was married, and that will never work out for anybody. Never, no way.\""

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"How Will I Know\" is a 1986 song recorded by American recording artist Whitney Houston for her eponymous debut album, which was released in February 1985. It was released by Arista Records in November that year, as the album's third single. Composed by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, the song was originally intended for Janet Jackson, but she passed on it. Houston then recorded the song with altered lyrics and production from Narada Michael Walden. The lyrics speak about the protagonist trying to discern if a boy she likes will ever like her back.\n\n\"How Will I Know\" received mainly positive reviews. The song became Houston's second number one single on the United States Billboard Hot 100. It spent two weeks atop the chart and also became Houston's first chart topper on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart. Success was worldwide: it reached the top 10 in Sweden, Ireland, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Switzerland.\n\nThe song's music video features scenes of Houston dancing in a setting of video screens and colored partitions. The music video gave Houston exposure to the teens and MTV. It also received nominations at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video and Best New Artist in a Video, winning the former category. The song was performed on many of her tours including Greatest Love Tour (1986) and her Nothing but Love World Tour (2009\u201310). \"How Will I Know\" is also featured as a remix on Houston's compilation album, Whitney: The Greatest Hits (2000), whereas the original version is featured on The Ultimate Collection (2007) and I Will Always Love You: The Best of Whitney Houston (2012; remastered).\n\nOriginally, songwriters George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam had written the song's demo for Janet Jackson, employed by A&M Records executive, John McClain. However, after hearing the song, Jackson's management passed on the song, feeling it was too weak in comparison to her other material. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Merrill expressed his feelings after learning of Jackson's decision. \"We were pretty upset because we thought it was perfect for her at the time. We had written it with her completely in mind.\" During this period, Brenda Andrews, at Almo-Irving Music, Merrill and Rubicam's publisher, played the song for Gerry Griffith, the director for R&B music at A&M and Arista Records. Griffith, who was compiling material for Houston's debut at the time, felt the song perfectly matched her sound. He soon contacted Andrews and the song's two writers and implored that they should relinquish the song to him for Houston's debut album. Griffith described his discovery of the song, and what he and Clive Davis thought of it:\n\n\"We had a lot of R&B-based tunes, we had a few ballads, but we didn't have a pop crossover song. So when I heard 'How Will I Know,' I said this is absolutely perfect. I played it for Clive  he fell in love with it. I wasn't very familiar with her family background, I didn't realize that even at that time there was a pretty big industry buzz about her future.\"\n\nAfter getting permission to use the song from Merrill, Griffith quickly turned to Narada Michael Walden, who was producing Aretha Franklin's \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\", for her album Who's Zoomin' Who?, at the time. After getting in touch with Walden, Griffith frantically implored him to produce the song, describing how important the song would be for Houston's future album. After hearing the song's demo, Walden agreed to fly down to San Rafael, California to arrange it. He was not much impressed with the demo and requested permission to change some of the song's lyrics and chord progression. Flustered by his request, Merrill and Rubicam denied him the right to their song. After a lot of back-and-forth with Griffith, they compromised and allowed Walden to de-construct the song and change the key and tempo. After completing the song, Houston came into the studio to record her vocals. Originally, Cissy Houston, the singer's mother, was intended to perform the song's background vocals. Houston had wanted to introduce her mother's vocals on the track, insisting on their inclusion. However, after hearing the finished result, Davis felt Houston's voice itself fit the song's arrangement, and implored her to sing the backup section on her own. While reluctant at first, Houston agreed and re-recorded the background vocals to the praise of both Griffith and Davis. Griffith explained:\n\n\"I asked Whitney to sing the background session. She was reluctant because she wanted to enjoy hearing her mother sing. I said, 'No, get out there and sing,' so she did. The background sounded incredible...Clive Davis heard the mix and immediately gave it a 10, which is outrageous for him, because he doesn't like anything!\""

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"The Greatest Love of All\" is a song written by composers Michael Masser (music) and Linda Creed (lyrics). It was originally recorded in 1977 by American singer and guitarist George Benson, who made the song a substantial hit, peaking at #2 on the R&B chart that year, the first R&B chart Top Ten hit for Arista Records. Eight years later, the song became even more well known for a version by Whitney Houston, whose 1985 cover (with the slightly amended title \"Greatest Love of All\") eventually topped the charts, peaking at #1 in Australia, Canada and the U.S. in 1986, reaching #1 on the R&B chart, also by Arista Records.\n\n\"The Greatest Love of All\" was written as the main theme of the 1977 film \"The Greatest\", a biopic of Muhammad Ali. Michael Masser wrote the music; he was later accused by Gordon Lightfoot of plagiarizing 24 bars of his 1971 hit \"If You Could Read My Mind\". (Specifically, the part of the song that begins \"I decided long ago...\" bears a marked compositional similarity to Lightfoot's passage in \"If You Could Read My Mind\" that begins \"I never thought I could feel this way...\") Lightfoot eventually dropped the suit out of respect for singer Whitney Houston.\n\nLinda Creed wrote the lyrics in the midst of her struggle with breast cancer. The title \"The Greatest Love of All\" refers to one's love for oneself. Nine years after the song was written, Creed ended up being the victim of cancer and she died on April 10, 1986 at the age of 37.\n\nThe song was further popularized by Whitney Houston under the title \"Greatest Love of All\". The song was recorded by the American recording artist for her debut album, self-titled Whitney Houston, which was released in February 1985, by Arista Records. The song became a major hit, topping the charts in Australia, Canada and the US, while reaching the top 20 in most countries, including Italy, Sweden and the UK. It remains her third biggest US hit, after \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\". All three songs, in order of their former popularity, re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart, after Houston's death, debuting the same week at numbers 7, 35 and 41, respectively, giving Houston three posthumous chart hits.\n\nClive Davis, founder of Houston's label Arista Records, was initially against Houston recording the song for her debut studio album, Whitney Houston, but he eventually gave in after persuasion from Houston and Masser. It was released as the B-side to the single \"You Give Good Love\", a previous Top 5 hit by Houston. The song, eventually released as a single in its own right, on March 18, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in May of that year.\n\nHouston's album version features a piano intro, while the single version begins with a keyboard intro. After the single became a success, it replaced the original album version on subsequent pressings of the album. However, the original version was restored for the 2010 Deluxe Anniversary Edition reissue of the album.\n\nHer live performance in 1990 in the 15th anniversary of Arista Records concert in Radio City Music Hall was included in the 25th anniversary deluxe edition of Whitney Houston and the 2014 CD/DVD release, Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances."

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" is the first single from Whitney Houston's second studio album Whitney. It was produced by Narada Michael Walden, and written by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam of the band Boy Meets Girl, who had previously written the number-one Whitney Houston hit \"How Will I Know.\" The original arrangement was more of a country tune, but was transformed by Walden to make it a dance song.\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics, who compared the musical arrangement to her own \"How Will I Know\" and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" The song won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 30th Grammy Awards. The single was a commercial success, topping the charts in 13 countries including Australia, Italy, Germany and the UK. In the US, it became her fourth consecutive number one single and sold over one million copies, making it her biggest hit in that country at the time. It was eventually surpassed by her version of \"I Will Always Love You\", five years later in 1992.\n\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" was written by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, who wrote Houston's 1985 song \"How Will I Know.\" \"How Will I Know\" became successful, and as a result, they were asked to come up with another song for Houston's then-new album. Originally the song that gave Merrill and Rubicam their British top ten success as Boy Meets Girl, \"Waiting For a Star to Fall\" was intended by the duo to be a song for Houston. The duo sent it to Arista Records, but they passed on it citing it was not suitable for Houston. Undeterred by this minor setback, the pair continued working on finding a song that would be ideal for Houston, and were inspired to come up with \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody.\" Later on, Rubicam explained the idea behind the song:\n\nI pictured somebody single wishing that they could find that special person for themselves. It wasn't, 'I wanna go down the disco and dance,' really. It was, 'I wanna do that dance of life with somebody.' That was the thought behind the song. So we sent our demo version off to Clive Davis and he loved it.\n\nBut, the song did not impress the producer, who again was Narada Michael Walden, who had produced \"How Will I Know.\" He took a little more persuading with regard to the song's potential, and at first was not too keen on having Houston record it, as he felt it was too \"country and western sounding.\" He said of it,\n\n reminded me of a rodeo song with Olivia Newton-John singing. I love Olivia Newton-John, but for Whitney Houston it didn't seem right. I felt the song needed a much more funkier feel. I slept, dreaming about it, woke up in the morning thinking about it, wondering what am I gonna do with this dance song. So, we just jumped in the water and lo and behold a magic record was born, Houston just knocked it out and then I knew we had a good record.\n\nThe video for \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" was directed by Brian Grant. The video features Houston in a pink dress and a continuous shot of a purple backdrop that never changes its angle of vision. In the intro of this video, Houston just finishes a performance onstage. She walks backstage, and the scene is intercut with more vivid, colorful images of her. The song then explodes into its beginning, with myriad locations and various outfits by Houston, as dancers trying to impress her as she dances. Towards the end of the song she manhandles a guy, who has a mixture of a look of shock and surprise asking him \"Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance\". The music video was in heavy rotation on music channels MTV, VH1, and BET during the song's run."

      "strDescriptionEN": "\"I Will Always Love You\" is a song written, composed, and originally recorded by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. The country track was released on June 6, 1974 as the second single from Parton's thirteenth solo studio album, Jolene (1974). The singer wrote the song, which was recorded on June 13, 1973, for her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, from whom she was professionally splitting at the time.\n\n\"I Will Always Love You\" received positive reviews from critics and attained commercial success, twice reaching number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. First, in June 1974 and a 1982 rerecording of the song also reached number one October of that year. With that accomplishment, Parton became the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song. The song also won Parton Female Vocalist at the CMA Awards, in 1975. Parton's 1982 recording of the song is from the soundtrack of the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\n\nWhitney Houston recorded a cover version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. Her single spent 14 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It has since become one of the best-selling singles of all time. Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" re-charted in 2012 after her death, making it the second single ever to reach the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 in separate chart runs.\n\nDolly Parton wrote the track in 1973 for her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, from whom she was separating professionally at the time. She recorded it in Nashville on June 13, 1973. Parton later re-recorded the song in 1982, when it was included on the soundtrack of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Author Curtis W. Ellison stated that the song \"speaks about the breakup of a relationship between a man and a woman that does not descend into unremitting domestic turmoil, but instead envisions parting with respect \u2013 because of the initiative of the woman.\" According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the country love track is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 66 beats per minute. During an interview, Parton's manager Danny Nozel said that \"one thing we found out from American Idol is that most people don't know that Dolly Parton wrote \".\n\nIn addition to The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas's soundtrack, Parton's original 1974 recording of the song also appeared in Martin Scorsese's film Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."

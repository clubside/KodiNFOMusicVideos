The album was one of those very rare cases that enjoyed global success by a new black female artist, topping the albums chart in many countries such as Canada, Australia, Norway and Sweden, peaking at number two in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland. The album was certified diamond for shipments of 10 million units or more on March 16, 1999, and later 13\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on July 29, 1999. It has sold over 25 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.\nAt the 28th Grammy Awards in 1986, Whitney Houston received four nominations including Album of the Year and won one of which, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for \"Saving All My Love for You\". For the 29th Grammy Awards of 1987, the album earned one nomination for Record of the Year for \"Greatest Love of All\".

In honor of its 25th anniversary, the album was re-released on January 26, 2010, in an expanded edition with five bonus tracks and a DVD.",

      "strReview": "In spite of Whitney Houston\u2019s recent soap opera of a life providing considerable entertainment, it\u2019s good to be see her back on television for the right reasons and doing what she ought to be doing, and judging from recent photos she looks astonishing and serenely comfortable with life. It seems the elder stateswoman of big-voice pop/soul is self-assuredly better looking and sounding than any of her apparent R&B rivals, which makes it a bit of a shame the album doesn\u2019t display that same confidence all the way through.\nIt all starts off well enough, with the opening track, Million Dollar Bill, setting the singer against a very modern-sounding background, but one with enough depth and actual musical substance to balance the size of her voice. It\u2019s like old-school soul only with up-to-date instruments. It\u2019s so precisely where Whitney should be that she sounds totally energised, sparring with the backing vocals and having fun inside a superbly funky arrangement. The next track, Nothin\u2019 But Love, takes a sparser, synthier approach but provides more than enough to give her a decent platform to work from and keeps things up-tempo fun and vocally playful.\nIn this setting even the comparatively anorexic third track Call You Tonight, which is little more than generic RnB, is sung so superbly it reinforces the fact that she\u2019s vastly superior many modern stars putting out material of a similar compositional standard. Then, just as audience and artist are revelling in Whitney Houston for the 21st century, we\u2019re yanked back in time with a series of identikit power ballads. True, this sort of thing is her trademark and people will expect it, but they say nothing about Whitney Houston that we didn\u2019t already know. They could\u2019ve come from any of her albums from the last 25 years \u2013 under other circumstances, titling one of them Like I Never Left might be considered ironic.  \nAlthough I Look to You does drag itself back to the present day with later tracks Worth It and For the Lovers, on which she sounds like she\u2019s enjoying herself again, especially on the elastic grooves of the latter, at this point it only shows up that middle section retreat into her safety zone as being even more unnecessary.",

Subsequently, I'm Your Baby Tonight would not be followed up with another studio album until 1998's My Love Is Your Love.\nLike many artists, Houston's previous efforts featured material mostly chosen by the label. With this project, however, she had more control over the album's content. In addition to working with the previous producers of Narada Michael Walden and Michael Masser, she also worked with the production team of L.A. Reid and Babyface, as well as singer Luther Vandross, and did a collaboration with Stevie Wonder. Houston would also produce the song \"I'm Knockin'\", with tour music director Ricky Minor. Stylistically, the album was a mixture of contemporary R&B, pop and adult contemporary.",

      "strReview": "Once upon a time there lived an extremely gifted pop princess who possessed beauty, poise and a set of vocals that would make the clouds smile. Critics were perplexed by this seemingly perfect specimen, and swiftly termed her bland and banal. However, a bad-boy husband, 120 million album sales, and rumours of a dubious lifestyle ensured that Whitney Houston never leaves the headlines.\nWith one of the most exceptional voices in contemporary music, her latest album, aptly titled Just Whitney sees the diva return to her former glory with a combination of high-voltage ballads and smooth-liqueur R&B.\n'Love That Man' sounds suspiciously like an ode to her much criticised hubby. Here Whitney comes across as soulful and sincere as she ooohs and aaahs in the right places. The mid-tempo track harks back to 80s soul with its simple bass line, and unfussy production.\n'One Of Those Days' also has a slight retro feel to it, cleverly sampling the Isley Brothers' Between the Sheets. Modern day women will be able to relate to this one, as Whitney croons about the need to withdraw from the pressures of day-to-day living for a spot of girlie pampering.\nWhitney has been experiencing her own fair share of pressure-cooker environments recently. For evidence, look no further than 'Whatchulookinat', an assertive, defiant statement against her critics. The gentle vocals, which appeared on previous tracks, have now been replaced by an authoritative Whitney stating: 'Unashamed by the life that I lead, the choices I've made, the things I have done, my belief in the one'.\nThe most welcomed return on Just Whitney is the incorporation of big love ballads; with the melancholic \"On My Own\" providing one of the album's highlights. The big-band orchestral feel to this track provides the perfect platform for Whitney to deliver vocally. Climaxing with one of those highly sustained notes sung in an octave that only the likes of Mariah, Celine and Aretha are capable of, she renders this track truly awesome.\nThe moral of this story is always stick to what you do best. Whitney's return to big ballads will hopefully ensure that this pop princess will be able to lead the rest of her life like a clich\u00e9d fairy tale - happily ever after.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Whitney: The Greatest Hits is a compilation album by American singer Whitney Houston, released in May 2000. The set consists of disc one with ballads and disc two with uptempo numbers and remixes. Houston's performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXV, and 1988 Olympics tribute \"One Moment in Time\" are also included in the set. The release is also on DVD format which includes music videos of past hits, as well as live performances and interviews. The collection includes four new songs \u2014 \"Could I Have This Kiss Forever\", duet with Enrique Iglesias, \"If I Told You That\", duet with George Michael, \"Same Script, Different Cast\", duet with Deborah Cox and \"Fine\" \u2014 all of which were released as singles. It also includes three other songs that had never appeared on a Houston album: \"One Moment in Time\", \"The Star Spangled Banner\", and \"If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful\", a duet with Jermaine Jackson from his 1986 Precious Moments album.\nUpon its release Whitney: The Greatest Hits was a commercial success, but it received mixed reviews from music critics. Many complained about the inclusion of remixes on disc two, instead of their original versions. It peaked within top ten in most European countries, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and received numerous platinum and multiplatinum awards. In November 2002, it was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 1.5 million in the United States. IFPI Europe also certified it three times platinum in 2000 for sales exceeding three million copies in Europe.\nAfter Houston\u2019s passing in February 2012, it saw resurgence in sales and re-entered album charts in many countries in Europe and in North America. In the United States, it reached a new peak of number two on the Billboard 200. In July 2012, it was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales exceeding 2.5 million in the United States. Worldwide the album has sold an estimated ten million copies to date.\nIn the United States, copies sold at Circuit City stores included a third disc containing new club remixes. Whitney: The Unreleased Mixes is a limited-edition four-record vinyl set, containing eight full club versions of selected remixes found on the American release. In June 2006, it was released digitally and re-titled Dance Vault Mixes: Whitney Houston \u2013 The Unreleased Mixes (Collector's Edition). In January 2011, the album was re-issued in Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand with the international track listing, but the set was retitled The Essential Whitney Houston. In addition to the title change, the re-release also features different artwork.",
